Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue.
Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin,
fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin.
In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes,
shortness of breath, or yellow skin.

There are two groups of tumors: benign tumors and malignant tumors.

Benign breast tumors: adenosis (A), fibroadenoma (F), phyllodes tumor (PT), and tubular adenona (TA);
Malignant tumors (breast cancer): carcinoma (DC), lobular carcinoma (LC), mucinous carcinoma (MC) and papillary carcinoma (PC).
